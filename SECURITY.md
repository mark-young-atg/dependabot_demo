# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This is a SaaS product. So the current version is supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please raise a security advisory through GitHub

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
